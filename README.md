# ImagesViewer

Java program that finds images using Google Custom Search and displays them in the worst-formatted slideshow ever.<br>
Took no time and has a bunch of errors I don't care enough to fix. <br>
Mostly I use it for Frankensteining a changing desktop background.<br><br>

Unfortunately, it does not accept queries with spaces in them. haven't found a good fix for it yet; using + seems to work
